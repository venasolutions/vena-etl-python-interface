### [pick one] Issue / Feature / Enhancement / Other
Link to the Zendesk ticket / Design Document (if available).
If no link available, please describe why the change is needed and how urgent it is.

### Customer visible change [REQUIRED: pick one]
Yes / No 
*DO NOT DELETE THIS HEADING - ANSWER THE QUESTION! READ ON*
If the PR fixes a customer visible bug, or otherwise changes product behavior in a way customers can experience, answer Yes.
If the PR is part of a quarterly release feature that has not yet shipped, or is not something customers can experience, answer No.
Delete the rest of this section other than the heading and the Yes or No answer.

### Customer visible change details
If you answered No to "Customer visible change", *DELETE this section*. DO NOT answer N/A here.
Otherwise *replace* the contents of this section with the details of the change as the customer will experience it. Those details will be added to the Jira issue when the pull request goes to production. Our technical writers search Jira for those details to document customer visible changes in their biweekly Release Updates to customers.

### Root Cause Analysis
